Welcome to Peng Zhou's homepage!

I am a PhD candidate at the University of Maryland, advised by Prof. Larry Davis. I received my Bachelorâ€™s degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 2015. My research interests lie in computer vision and deep learning that applied on media forensics, object detection, image/video segmentation, image sythesis and incremental learning.

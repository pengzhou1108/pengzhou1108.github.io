Welcome to Peng Zhou's homepage!

I am a PhD candidate at the University of Maryland, advised by Prof. Larry Davis. I received my Bachelor's degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 2015. My research interests lie in computer vision and deep learning that applied to media forensics, object detection, image/video segmentation, image synthesis and incremental learning.
